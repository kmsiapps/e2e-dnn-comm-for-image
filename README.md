## Requirements
`tensorflow`
`tensorflow_addons`

## Get started
`python ./train.py` for training
`python ./evalute.py` for evalutation

You may refer to [this issue](https://github.com/kmsiapps/e2e-dnn-comm-for-image/issues/2) for further instructions.
There is currently no command line arguments; please edit the codes before you run them.
